Our app is a game designed to teach players about budgeting and taking care of the environment. The player enters the game after being elected as the mayor to a new city. The previous government, however, left the city in a not-so-great spot, with lots of factories, drills, and other things polluting the environment. As the new mayor, the player helps rebuild the city, turning it into a thriving metropolis fueled by renewable energy. The new mayor has to budget their funds properly, making sure they can meet energy demands without polluting the environment. As the game progresses, new technologies are unlocked, which produce more energy and reduce surrounding pollution. The game is about maintaining the perfect balance between the happiness of the people, their energy usage and demands, and the health of the environment. This balance is similar to what politicians today have to manage, making sure their policies are the right ones for the people. Our hope is that our game can help future congresspeople understand the impact that humans have on the environment, and that they will be inspired to make change with this game.
